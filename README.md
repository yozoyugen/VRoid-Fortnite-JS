## Summary
TPS game sample like Fortnite using Three.js, Rapier.js and VRoid 3D model.  
Implemented Fortnite build and edit function.  
The reason for releasing this repository is to help developers who want to make TPS games.  
I think we need some experience to make new original game.  
As you know, Fortnite is a huge hit game.  
By creating a copy of a hit game, we can learn many elements of game development.  
So, by creating and publishing a game that imitates Fortnite, we can get a lot of experience and learn a lot from it.  
I think creating a game is not a goal but just a start.  
Because running a game is much harder than creating it.  
Use this repository to help you take the next step towards running your game faster.  
Furthermore, if you add just one of your ideas, it might become even more fun than the original.
